# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add caller-ordered, all-or-nothing remote mdoc batch preparation that
  validates every request before randomness, flattens item commitments into
  one identity-checked scalar digest call, and returns the existing opaque
  signing state without signing, activating, or persisting credentials. Mdoc
  preparation now also rejects unrepresentable validity intervals with one
  stable error before salt allocation or digest execution.

### Changed

- Prepare the synchronized Marty 0.2 release: credential issuer operations now
  expose only remote KMS prepare/assemble flows, secret-returning crypto APIs
  use zeroizing wrappers, and verification/session capabilities require their
  explicit Cargo features. Applications that previously generated, imported,
  serialized, or used credential private keys in Marty must move those
  operations to their remote key manager.
- Compile JOSE verification APIs only when `jose-verification` or a consuming
  issuer/verifier/wallet/LTI role selects the maintained verification provider;
  no-role protocol/type builds no longer expose a backend they do not contain.
- Require the explicit Ed448/eMRTD capability before compiling the Ed448
  backend; ordinary EdDSA and KMS issuer builds now contain Ed25519 verification
  only, while CSCA/eMRTD builds retain Ed448 verification.
- Advance the exact ElevenID `sd-jwt-rs` pin through its reviewed serial
  issuance and verification refactors and consumer-compatible WASM dependency
  resolution while keeping `parallel` and benchmark features disabled. Wallet
  presentation construction uses the dependency's explicit unverified
  constructor to preserve its existing preverified-input contract; issuer-key
  resolution and holder-key/`cnf` validation remain a separate product change.
- Advance the maintained ElevenID `isomdl` pin through its reviewed
  caller-ordered, all-or-nothing mdoc batch preparation and opt-in safe-SIMD
  digest qualification surfaces while leaving Marty issuance on the existing
  scalar path and keeping both `parallel` and `simd` disabled; target
  measurements did not justify production SIMD selection.
- Route Marty mdoc item commitments through an identity-checked serial
  plan/execute/assemble boundary while preserving salt allocation, CBOR bytes,
  claim order, signing input, final assembly, and feature defaults.

### Security

- Reject weak-key Ed25519 forgeries and non-canonical EC/Ed25519 SubjectPublicKeyInfo
  metadata at every public verification entry point.
- Reject small-order Ed25519 issuer keys in remote credential completion and
  verify returned EdDSA signatures with strict Ed25519 semantics.
- Keep Ed448 eMRTD verification while compiling only the backend's public
  curve/scalar operations; CI rejects its combined signing, PKCS#8, serde,
  standard-library, and default features in the production KMS+CSCA graph.
- Remove local credential-private-key APIs from production Rust and Python
  artifacts, enforce KMS-only dependency graphs, zeroize mdoc/ZK/session secret
  state on success and failure, and bind every opaque remote signature to the
  exact prepared payload and public key.
- Remove the unsound `im` and `sized-chunks` path from linked-data traversal
  through an exact, behavior-locked ElevenID revision.
- Reject mdoc holder P-256 and P-384 JWK coordinates that are not valid points
  on their declared curves before issuing a device-bound credential.
- Bound EUDI LoTL and member-state trusted-list downloads to 16 MiB before
  XML parsing, including streamed responses without a declared length.
- Upgrade `quick-xml` to 0.41.0 to fix quadratic duplicate-attribute checks
  and unbounded namespace-declaration allocation in network-supplied XML.

## [0.1.61] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Support explicitly installed process-local credential stores so secure
  storage can be qualified in headless environments without weakening the
  platform-keychain default.

### Fixed

- Track offline reporting attempts and acknowledgements atomically with exact
  batch metadata and durable retry state.
- Canonicalize DTC signatures independently of the shared `serde_json` feature
  graph while preserving verification of already-issued legacy payloads.

## [0.1.60] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Restore the complete retired CSCA bootstrap algorithm set: RSA-2048,
  RSA-3072, RSA-4096, ECDSA P-256, ECDSA P-384, and ECDSA P-521.
- Support cross-algorithm CSCA-to-DSC chains while keeping the DSC subject-key
  algorithm independent from its issuer's signing algorithm.

### Fixed

- Normalize P-521/ES512 signatures for certificate and eMRTD verification and
  preserve explicit algorithm selection through the authority-issuance API.

### Security

- Validate RSASSA-PSS algorithm parameters across certificate, CRL, OCSP, SOD,
  master-list, and eMRTD chain verification, including declared salt length
  and matching MGF1 digest.

## [0.1.59] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- Require the explicit `authority-issuance` feature for CSCA and document-signer
  authority APIs while retaining eMRTD verification in the default verifier.
- Separate CRL verification from CRL construction and narrow the normal crypto
  feature composition used by Verification, Bindings, OID4VCI, and ISO 18013.

### Security

- Exclude certificate, CRL, SOD, and key-generation builder features from the
  default verifier and released Python verifier wheel dependency graphs.

## [0.1.58] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Resolve standards-conformant `did:web` identifiers with percent-encoded
  non-default ports through configured managed resolvers and direct HTTPS
  resolution.

### Security

- Restrict decoded `did:web` authorities to domain names and a single valid
  `%3Aport` delimiter, and require an exact `host:port` allowlist entry before
  direct resolution on a non-default port.

## [0.1.57] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Add canonical credential evidence, reconciliation, governance, VCDM,
  key-attestation, and status-token decisions for fail-closed service adapters.
- Add canonical passport-chip active-authentication, EAC, APDU, DG14/DG15,
  MRZ, SOD, and LDS parsing kernels, plus trust-registry synchronization
  planning and verification.
- Add SPKI and X.509 public-key-to-JWK conversion and DER-to-P1363 ECDSA
  normalization for signing, JWKS, DID, and OID4VCI consumers.
- Add bounded W3C Bitstring Status List decoding that derives list length from
  GZIP output while enforcing the privacy floor and global size limit.
- Add strict one-recipient-DID X25519 DIDComm authcrypt encryption and
  decryption APIs using the existing ECDH-1PU/A256CBC-HS512 engine, including
  every authorized recipient key-agreement method and Python bindings that
  return authenticated sender and recipient key identifiers.

### Security

- Reject malformed credential decisions, attestations, document data,
  certificates, public keys, signatures, trust synchronization inputs, and
  compressed status lists without falling back to non-Rust implementations.
- Select DIDComm key IDs and public-key material atomically from verification
  methods explicitly authorized by each DID document's `keyAgreement`
  relationship. Reject sender/private-key mismatch, anoncrypt downgrade,
  legacy ECDH-1PU derivation, and authenticated plaintext party substitution.

## [0.1.56] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Correct the `0.1.55` mobile-document issuance regression by computing each
  MSO value digest over the complete serialized tag-24
  `IssuerSignedItemBytes`, matching Marty verification and interoperable wallet
  implementations in both direct and externally signed issuance paths.

### Security

- Keep verification fail-closed while ensuring issuer-authenticated mdoc
  disclosures bind the exact bytes delivered to wallets; the former inner-item
  commitment produced credentials whose disclosures failed standards-aligned
  digest verification.

## [0.1.55] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Restore ISO 18013-5 mobile-document value digests to the encoded
  `IssuerSignedItem` bytes carried by `IssuerSignedItemBytes`, matching the
  unchanged EUDI/Multipaz verifier calculation in direct and externally signed
  issuance paths.

### Security

- Preserve operating-system CSPRNG salts while preventing standards-compliant
  wallets from rejecting issued mdoc credentials because the digest included
  the surrounding tag-24 wrapper.

## [0.1.54] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Compute ISO 18013-5 mobile-document value digests over the complete tagged
  `IssuerSignedItemBytes` encoding in both direct and externally signed
  issuance paths.

### Security

- Generate issuer-signed item salts atomically with the operating system CSPRNG
  and bind every MSO digest entry to the exact encoded item delivered to the
  wallet, preventing valid third-party wallets from rejecting credentials whose
  issuer authentication cannot be reproduced.

## [0.1.53] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Add canonical P-256 `did:jwk` and `did:key` identifier derivation to
  `marty-didcomm` and expose it through `_marty_rs`.
- Advertise `did_identifier_derivation` in native backend diagnostics for
  startup and readiness enforcement.

### Changed

- Consolidate self-describing verifier DID construction in Rust so Python
  callers no longer canonicalize JWKs, compress curve points, or encode
  multicodec identifiers.

### Security

- Reject private JWK material, malformed or incorrectly sized coordinates,
  off-curve P-256 points, and unsupported DID methods.

## [0.1.52] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Add canonical ISO 18013-7 OpenID4VP mdoc handover and SessionTranscript
  construction with RFC 7638 client identifier thumbprints.
- Expose non-reversible OpenID4VP response-URI and nonce binding digests
  through `_marty_rs` with shared cross-language golden vectors.
- Add canonical HAIP response-encryption key generation and compact JWE
  decryption with RFC 7518 Concat KDF interoperability vectors.
- Add bounded OID4VP `x509_hash` identity construction with certificate-chain
  parsing, SHA-256 client identifiers, and `x5c` shaping.
- Add canonical SIOPv2 ID-token verification for JWK-thumbprint subjects.
- Add network-free P-256 holder-key generation and reconstruction for public
  `did:jwk` identifiers with separately returned private key material.

### Changed

- Make `marty-iso18013` the single owner of OpenID4VP mdoc transcript and
  handover encoding used by Python compatibility adapters.
- Route HAIP ECDH, KDF, authenticated decryption, OID4VP x509 identity, SIOPv2
  signature and subject binding, and wallet holder-key decisions through their
  canonical Rust owners and typed `_marty_rs` operations.

### Security

- Bound and validate OpenID4VP handover inputs and fail closed for malformed
  JWKs, unsupported keys, empty identifiers or nonces, and oversized values.
- Reject malformed or oversized JWE, certificate, token, and holder-key input;
  unsupported algorithms or curves; certificate/key mismatches; unauthenticated
  SIOPv2 subjects; and private key material embedded in `did:jwk` identifiers.

## [0.1.51] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Add an explicit presentation-proof policy obligation independently from
  credential obligations and expose it through the native binding.
- Expose controlled DID resolution with native source, timestamp, and content
  digest provenance through `_marty_rs`.
- Add a canonical OID4VP request builder for equivalent Presentation Exchange
  and DCQL credential queries and expose it through `_marty_rs`.

### Changed

- Run faster affected-package pull-request feedback while preserving the full
  verification matrix on merge candidates, and cancel superseded workflow runs.
- Dispatch and await the full verification matrix on the exact protected-main
  release source before creating an immutable stable tag.
- Centralize OID4VP format normalization, algorithm policy, Open Badge aliases,
  mdoc claim paths, disclosure requirements, and resource limits in Rust.

### Security

- Require independently verified presentation proof when configured, without
  allowing that proof to satisfy a missing credential obligation or create
  credential-policy partiality.
- Reject private, duplicate, malformed, or incomplete `did:jwk` key material
  before returning a DID document, and preserve validated document members.
- Reject empty OID4VP policies, incompatible formats, duplicate descriptors or
  claims, incomplete credential metadata, and missing mdoc mappings.

## [0.1.50] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Add a canonical Open Badges 3.0 profile validator beside the Rust issuance
  profile builder.
- Expose composite Open Badge VC-JWT verification through `_marty_rs`.

### Changed

- Authenticate VC-JWT signatures, issuer binding, validity, VCDM structure,
  and Open Badge semantics through one Rust verification boundary.

### Security

- Clear credential claims when the JWT signature or Open Badge profile is
  rejected so callers cannot consume unverified badge data.

## [0.1.49] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Add canonical Rust-owned OID4VP and DCQL presentation metadata for Open
  Badges 3.0 VC-JWT and legacy SD-JWT application profiles.
- Expose an explicit `credential_presentation_metadata` native capability for
  startup and health diagnostics.

### Changed

- Reuse the Open Badges 3.0 credential type emitted by the Rust issuer when
  constructing presentation requirements.
- Preserve current and legacy Open Badge SD-JWT VCT matching through the same
  Rust profile resolver instead of caller-side mappings.

### Security

- Reject unknown profiles, unsupported presentation formats, missing SD-JWT
  VCT identifiers, and malformed native presentation metadata fail closed.

## [0.1.48] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Add canonical Open Badges 3.0 JWT-VC profile construction and a dedicated
  native preparation capability for fail-closed caller startup validation.
- Add canonical native credential-format routing for JSON, JWT VC, SD-JWT,
  Open Badges, and mdoc verification candidates.

### Changed

- Discover OID4VCI authorization-server metadata before token exchange and
  require exact issuer metadata instead of guessing a token endpoint.
- Consolidate Open Badges context, credential type, achievement subject, and
  achievement construction in the Rust OID4VCI owner.

### Security

- Reject malformed or conflicting Open Badges profile data, unknown native
  profile requests, malformed compact tokens, and unavailable native routing
  operations instead of falling back to caller-side interpretation.

## [0.1.47] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Add VC-JWT receipt, credential inventory, DCQL matching, and presentation to
  the Rust browser test wallet through the canonical OID4VCI/OID4VP engine.

### Changed

- Preserve strict SD-JWT VCT matching while allowing the browser test wallet
  to exercise the conformant Open Badge VC-JWT login path.

### Security

- Reject unsupported credential formats and VC-JWT type mismatches instead of
  selecting or presenting an incompatible credential.

## [0.1.46] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Add the canonical public status-list crate and Python raw-byte constructors
  for Token Status List and Bitstring Status List compatibility adapters.
- Add canonical Rust flow-decision and device-authentication kernels with
  bounded inputs, normalized outcomes, and fail-closed transition/proof rules.
- Add canonical wallet QR classification for OID4VCI, OID4VP, and ISO 18013
  mdoc inputs for Flutter Rust Bridge consumers.
- Add a bounded VDS-NC CMC, MRV, and eVisa profile kernel with canonical JSON,
  barcode correction, signing, verification, and Python bindings.
- Add a canonical external DTC signing handoff that prepares exact signing
  bytes and authenticates provider signatures before assembly.

### Changed

- Centralize status-list, flow, device-authentication, wallet QR, VDS-NC, and
  DTC signing decisions in their reusable Rust owners for thin caller adapters.
- Consolidate the retained VDS-NC document profile, canonical envelope,
  component policy, barcode selection, and typed Python operations in Rust.

### Security

- Reject malformed, oversized, unsupported, replayed, or cryptographically
  invalid inputs across the new kernels instead of allowing caller fallbacks.
- Require Rust to verify externally produced DTC signatures against the exact
  canonical payload before a DTC can be marked signed.

## [0.1.45] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Add the canonical service-level presentation-policy request, decision,
  violation, and normalized result API to `marty-verification` and `_marty_rs`.
- Add bounded policy parsing, verified credential facts, holder-binding,
  freshness, revocation, issuer, alternative-requirement, and external
  authorization evaluation with stable error codes.

### Changed

- Route the legacy wallet policy evaluator and claim, issuer, and freshness
  compatibility helpers through the canonical service evaluator so there is
  one maintained allow/deny implementation.

### Security

- Fail closed when policy facts are malformed, unsupported, ambiguous,
  incomplete, stale, untrusted, revoked, replayable, or missing required
  cryptographic and authorization evidence.

## [0.1.44] - 2026-08-10

### Security

- Stop treating a DTC's issuance-time `is_revoked: false` claim as current
  lifecycle evidence. Current-good status now requires fresh, exactly bound,
  provenance-bearing evidence supplied through a governed orchestrator context.
- Preserve declared or authenticated revocation as fail-closed while keeping
  cryptographic validity separate from unavailable, stale, malformed, or
  mismatched lifecycle evidence.
- Add explicit passed, failed, not-performed, and error outcomes to DTC checks,
  with stable diagnostics for unavailable and unusable current-status evidence.

## [0.1.43] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Add canonical fail-closed OpenID Connect token validation with typed stable
  error codes, issuer/audience/authorized-party/nonce/time-claim policy, JWKS
  key selection, algorithm allowlisting, and access-token hash verification.
- Expose OIDC validation and native backend/version/capability diagnostics
  through the supported `_marty_rs` Python binding surface.

### Security

- Reject malformed, unsigned, ambiguously keyed, expired, not-yet-valid,
  incorrectly issued, incorrectly addressed, or nonce-mismatched OIDC tokens.
- Require callers to receive an explicit native error when the Rust extension
  or required capability is unavailable; no Python validation fallback exists.

## [0.1.42] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Build Linux aarch64 wheels natively on ARM against the supported manylinux
  2.28 ABI so compilers, system libraries, and package architecture agree.

### Changed

- Preflight the affected Linux aarch64 Python packages when release workflow
  or Rust dependency metadata changes, before creating an immutable tag.

## [0.1.41] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Use distro-native Perl packaging in Linux release-wheel containers and
  verify the OpenSSL build modules are available before cross compilation.

## [0.1.40] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Make Linux release-wheel dependency installation portable across the current
  Debian-family cross images and RPM-family manylinux images.

### Security

- Require verifier-governed CSCA trust anchors and a validated DTC Signer
  certificate chain before a Digital Travel Credential can be accepted.
- Require the critical ICAO DTC-signing extended key usage and reject missing,
  partial, malformed, mismatched, or wrong-purpose trust material with a stable
  trust-chain failure.

## [0.1.36] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Expose typed, signature-authenticated mdoc document evidence from the Python
  presentation-verification binding, including the authenticated document type,
  algorithms, MSO validity interval, and issuer-certificate fingerprint.

### Security

- Require a protected ES256 issuer algorithm and a valid Tag24 Mobile Security
  Object whose version, document type, chronology, and current validity agree
  with the authenticated document.
- Report revocation as unchecked and unknown when no status authority ran,
  preventing downstream consumers from inventing positive non-revocation.

## [0.1.35] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Verify every disclosed issuer-signed mdoc value against the namespace and
  digest-ID commitment authenticated by the Mobile Security Object.
- Replace the permissive mdoc validity placeholder with deterministic verifier-
  time evaluation, including inclusive validity boundaries.

### Security

- Reject altered disclosures, missing namespace or digest commitments,
  malformed timestamps, contradictory validity chronology, not-yet-valid
  evidence, and expired evidence.

## [0.1.34] - 2026-08-07

### Documentation

- Correct the public Python binding documentation to describe the implemented
  DIDComm Messaging 2.1 X25519 anoncrypt profile: `ECDH-ES+A256KW` key wrapping
  with required `A256CBC-HS512` content encryption.
- Scope `marty-didcomm` package metadata to the credential-delivery capability
  that is implemented and tested instead of implying a complete DIDComm agent.

## [0.1.33] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Replace the partial hand-written DIDComm JWE implementation with a maintained,
  exact-pinned envelope engine.
- Produce DIDComm Messaging 2.1 X25519 anoncrypt envelopes whose `epk`, `apv`,
  `alg`, `enc`, and media type are integrity protected.
- Use `ECDH-ES+A256KW` with the required `A256CBC-HS512` content-encryption
  profile, and fail closed on malformed recipient binding or authentication.

### Changed

- Raise the workspace MSRV to Rust 1.95 to match the maintained DIDComm
  dependency; the repository toolchain remains pinned to Rust 1.97.1.
- Document the exact credential-delivery profile Marty currently supports and
  keep full-agent authcrypt, routing, additional curves, and state-machine
  interoperability as explicit tracked capabilities rather than broad claims.

### Security

- Remove Marty's duplicate JOSE, ECDH, AES, and key-wrapping implementation from
  the DIDComm boundary.
- Add negative tests for wrong recipient keys and missing protected `apv`, plus
  an unmodified DIDComm Messaging 2.1 Appendix C authcrypt vector that verifies
  sender authentication and the corrected ECDH-1PU key derivation.

## [0.1.32] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Implement the current ETSI TS 119 472-3 key-attestation proof rule used by
  the official EUDI wallet: the canonical `kid` value `"0"` selects only the
  first public key in the issuer-policy-validated `attested_keys` array.
- Correct the 0.1.31 interpretation that rejected the current ETSI first-key
  selector as a non-standard compatibility convention.

### Security

- Accept `"0"` only for a proof carrying the exact issuer-validated key
  attestation; reject every other numeric value, alternate spelling, named key
  identifier, missing key, private key, and signature made by a later array
  element.
- Keep imported official compliance-suite sources byte-for-byte unchanged.

## [0.1.31] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Align key-attestation-bound OID4VCI proofs with the Final specification by
  accepting an embedded public `jwk` only when its RFC 7638 thumbprint matches
  a key in the issuer-policy-validated attestation.
- Resolve a proof `kid` only when it uniquely identifies an attested JWK or a
  self-certifying `did:key` whose public key is present in the attestation.
- Remove Marty's pre-1.0, non-standard numeric `kid`-as-array-index convention.

### Security

- Continue requiring the exact issuer-profile-validated attestation token and
  verify the proof signature with the public key bound to that token.
- Reject private, unattested, ambiguous, or mutually conflicting proof keys.
- Keep imported official compliance suites, fixtures, assertions, expected
  results, selections, and exclusions unchanged; the interoperability fix is
  entirely in ElevenID product code.

## [0.1.30] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Verify OID4VCI proofs whose numeric `kid` selects a public key from the
  `attested_keys` claim in an issuer-policy-validated key-attestation JWT.
- Expose the same fail-closed key-attestation proof boundary through the
  production Python binding used by credential services.

### Security

- Require the proof header to carry the exact validated attestation token and
  derive its verification key directly from that token; callers cannot supply
  a separate key list that could drift from the issuer's trust decision.
- Reject unvalidated key-attestation headers, mismatched or malformed tokens,
  empty key sets, nonnumeric or out-of-range key indices, private/symmetric
  keys, and signatures made by a key other than the selected attested key.
- Keep imported official compliance suites, fixtures, assertions, expected
  results, selections, and exclusions unchanged; remediation remains entirely
  in ElevenID product code.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Require an explicitly typed OID4VCI holder proof with audience and issued-at
  claims, and verify every accepted proof signature against resolved public
  key material.
- Preserve a self-certifying `did:key` client identifier only when it resolves
  to the exact key that verified the proof; arbitrary OAuth client IDs no
  longer become holder identities.
- Scope Cargo target caches by operating system, architecture, and Rust
  toolchain so native build artifacts are never restored across incompatible
  runners.

### Security

- Remove the fail-open path that accepted an unresolved, non-`did:key` `kid`
  without cryptographic verification.
- Reject missing or invalid `typ`, `aud`, and `iat` claims, conflicting `kid`
  and `jwk` headers, tampered signatures, and mismatched self-certifying DIDs.
- Keep imported official compliance suites, fixtures, assertions, and
  expected results unchanged; remediation is entirely in product code.

## [0.1.28] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Verify mdoc issuer and device signatures against the exact session transcript
  bytes supplied by the verifier instead of reconstructing a substitute.

## [0.1.27] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Enforce W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2 protected-context
  boundaries.
- Record and pin the maintained ElevenID `isomdl` compatibility fork while its
  upstream synchronization remains review-only.

## [0.1.26] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Accept standards-compliant mdoc presentations whose optional disclosed
  namespaces are empty while preserving issuer and device authentication.
- Separate exact document-signer certificate pinning from root-CA trust:
  pinned issuer certificates require an exact DER match, while root-CA trust
  continues to enforce the full PKIX chain and signing key-usage policy.
- Expose pinned document-signer certificates through the stable Python
  verification binding without changing existing call behavior.

### Security

- Continue failing closed for wrong pins, expired certificates, invalid
  embedded certificate chains, invalid issuer signatures, and invalid holder
  device-authentication signatures.
- Pin the maintained ElevenID `isomdl` compatibility fork by immutable commit
  while its monthly upstream synchronization remains review-only.

## [0.1.25] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Emit ISO 18013-5 `x5chain` certificate material in the COSE unprotected
  header while retaining the signing algorithm in the protected header.
- Preserve the same certificate-chain behavior across local signing and
  remote issuer-profile prepare/assemble signing.

### Security

- Continue requiring certificate material to come from the resolved
  issuer-profile context; credential claims cannot override the trusted chain.

## [0.1.24] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Allow the internal verification boundary to consume resolver-owned public
  verification methods for tenant-scoped DID documents while retaining
  offline `did:key` resolution.

### Security

- Require exact verification-method IDs and controllers, reject duplicate or
  conflicting methods and private JWK parameters, and fail verification for
  wrong keys, invalid signatures, and tampered credentials.
- Keep DID resolution and tenant authorization outside the cryptographic
  verifier so no public profile, key, KMS, provider, or custody selector is
  introduced.

## [0.1.23] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Allow W3C VC Data Model v2 credentials with syntactically valid past or
  future validity periods to complete remote Data Integrity signing.
- Keep current-time expiration and premature-credential policy in the normal
  public verifier instead of applying it to issuance.

### Security

- Validate RFC 3339 validity fields and reject reversed validity periods
  before signing.
- Continue verifying the exact remotely returned Data Integrity proof and
  reject invalid signatures, tampered credentials, and signing substitutions.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Prepare and complete native W3C VC Data Model v2
  `eddsa-rdfc-2022` Data Integrity proofs around externally managed signing.
- Expose the canonical signing bytes to issuer-profile-mediated custody and
  return only public verification material with the completed credential.

### Security

- Reject private JWK parameters at the binding boundary.
- Bind completion to the DID, verification method, algorithm, cryptosuite,
  proof purpose, and unsigned credential established during preparation.
- Verify the completed proof before returning it so invalid or substituted
  signatures fail closed.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-07-26

### Bug Fixes

- Extract authenticated claims from every disclosed mdoc document type and
  namespace, including ICAO Digital Travel Credentials.
- Preserve unique element identifiers as flat compatibility keys and expose
  the complete document/namespace structure under `_mdoc`; omit ambiguous flat
  names rather than overwriting claims.
- Keep verification independent of KMS coordinates. Issuer signing remains
  selected through the issuer profile and its DID verification method.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-07-26

### Bug Fixes

- Bind the public key from the wallet's cryptographically verified OID4VCI
  proof into `MobileSecurityObject.deviceKeyInfo.deviceKey`, enabling
  standards-compliant mdoc holder `DeviceAuthentication`.
- Encode only the public EC coordinates in the canonical COSE_Key and reject
  incomplete or unsupported holder keys.
- Keep issuer authentication signing behind the selected issuer profile and
  its DID verification method; no caller-facing KMS identifier or holder
  private key is introduced.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-07-26

### Bug Fixes

- Expose complete ISO 18013-5 issuer, trust-chain, and holder
  `DeviceAuthentication` verification through the released `marty_rs` Python
  binding used by production presentation-policy services.
- Retain the existing VCDM, SD-JWT, OID4VCI, OID4VP, and DIDComm binding
  surface while adding mdoc parsing and disclosed-claim extraction.
- Keep signing behind issuer profiles and DID verification methods; verifier
  bindings accept no KMS service or key coordinate.

## [0.1.18] - 2026-07-26

### Bug Fixes

- Embed ISO 18013-5 `issuerAuth` as the untagged COSE_Sign1 array expected by
  mdoc wallet parsers while retaining tag-24 `MobileSecurityObjectBytes`.
- Preserve issuer-profile and DID verification-method signing; KMS routing
  remains an internal profile binding and is not exposed to issuance callers.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-07-25

### Bug Fixes

- Encode ISO 18013-5 `MobileSecurityObjectBytes` as tagged encoded CBOR in
  issuer authentication payloads for both local and issuer-profile signing.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-07-25

### Features

- Verify holder `DeviceAuthentication` signatures for every ISO 18013-5
  document against a verifier-supplied session transcript.

### Maintenance

- Adopt PyO3 0.29's explicit `from_py_object` behavior for existing Python
  classes without changing their conversion semantics.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-07-24

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve an issuance service's reserved mdoc credential identifier across
  issuer-profile signing so retry protection does not reject a successfully
  assembled credential.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-07-22

### Bug Fixes

- Accept cryptographically valid VCDM v2 presentations that omit the optional `holder` property while continuing to bind a supplied holder to the Data Integrity verification method controller.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-07-22

### Bug Fixes

- Make the VCDM JWT tampering regression deterministic by changing decoded
  signature bytes rather than ambiguous base64url padding bits.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-07-22

### Features

- Verify standalone W3C VCDM v2 JWT credentials with EdDSA or ES256 through the released Python binding.
- Resolve `did:key` verification methods or consume only public issuer-profile JWK material.

### Security

- Reject private JWK members, unsupported algorithms, issuer/controller mismatches, tampering, and invalid temporal or registered-claim mappings.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-07-21

### Features

- Verify W3C VCDM v2 `eddsa-rdfc-2022` credentials and presentations through the released Python binding.
- Resolve `did:key` verification methods offline, bind presentation challenge and domain, and independently verify embedded credentials.

### Security

- Reject unsupported proof suites, proof purposes, malformed multibase proof values, signature tampering, and challenge or domain mismatches.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-07-21

### Bug Fixes

- Encode ISO 18013-5 full-date claims with RFC 8943 CBOR tag 1004 while retaining tag 0 for RFC 3339 date-times.

### CI

- Enforce append-only release metadata and Cargo-derived Python package versions.
